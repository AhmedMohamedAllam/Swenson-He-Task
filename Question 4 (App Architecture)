IV. Which architecture would you use for the required task below? Why?

Answer:
I prefer using MVP (Mode-View-Presenter) here, as all UI view updates based on user interaction,
so the view will respond to user interctions throght UI, 
then call Presenter which contain all logic and behave according to user needs.
beside there is calculations and business logic so we need to encapsulate that logic away from the UI, to be able to test it,
so the presenter is the best solution here from my prospective.
